# Personally Identifiable Information

Many roles deal with data containing personally identifiable
information (PII). This document provides guidance in identifying and
general guidelines for working with PII.

1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as information
   identifying or that might be used to identify a natural person.
2. Information classified as PII should never be sent over unencrypted
   channels.
3. PII controlled by the company may not be transferred to the systems
   outside the company's control, unless a written contract exists
   with the controlling party.
4. Users should strive avoid excessive access to PII in performing their role.
5. Accessing PII for purposes irrelevant to the user's role is
   prohibited.
6. Customer PII may only be shared if compliant with the Terms of
   Service agreed to by the customer.
7. Examples of PII include national identity numbers
   (sv. personnummer) and equivalents, postal addresses,
   phone numbers.
8. Any combination of information that might together identify a
   natural person is to be treated as PII. For example, a first name
   and an employer might in some cases be sufficient to identify a
   person.
